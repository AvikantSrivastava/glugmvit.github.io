# What is VCS?
VCS refers to Version Control System. Most of you must have got intimated by reading the very first line and would have made up your mind that VCS is something that is probably “out of your league”. Read ahead cause VCS isn’t rocket science.

# Application of VCS in the real world: Know about the V (versioning) through VCS

How many of you have used the Google Chrome app on your phone? Almost everyone, I guess. For instance,an updated version of the app has been recently rolled out. However the developer team finds out that the latest update rolled out by them is causing the app to unexpectedly stop working in some devices. To fix this problem temporarily, they want the older version of the app to be rolled out for consumption. It is very difficult for the developers to find out which line of code among the 10,000 lines of code is causing such a problem.

This is where VCS makes the life of developers easy. The Google Chrome developers team has a copy of the code of the older version of the app stored in a version control system that is keeping a track of all the files and code associated with the app from the very beginning.

The VCS has special tools that marks where the changes in the code has been made. The places where the code has been changed are marked usually in a green color and the older/initial line of code is marked in red color. The developer executes few lines of code in the VCS terminal and the Google Chrome app is now working efficiently. This is the power of VCS.

## My Previous Experience
We were a team of four members who were making a mobile application for our college. I was working on the front-end layer of the app. The other one was responsible for the back end of the app, while the other two were working on the middle-ware that connects the front end elements with the back end so that the app works properly and can be consumed hassle free.

One fine day, the back end guy made some changes in the source code and the app got completely messed up and was not working properly.

Our team later found out that all this drama was happening because of the change that was made in the back end wasn’t well coordinated with the other two layers , i.e. the front end and the middle ware. Thus, to have a collaborative working environment and keep track of all the three working layers, a need for Version Control Systems is very much required.

## THE BIRTH OF VCS
The birth of version control systems took place around 1982 when Walter F. Tichy came out with the first Version Control System(popularly then known as RCS). RCS was developed as part of the GNU project. These systems started gaining popularity among the developers very rapidly, thanks to the formidable growth of the Open-Source Community in the last 2 decades. Without going into the other details of VCS, let us see how Git- a well known Version Control System tool works and how can we make the most of it.

## Writing code blocks

There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, `like this`. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:

```css
.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```

If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.

## Reference lists

The quick brown jumped over the lazy.

Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.

## Full HTML

Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:

<p><iframe style="width:100%;" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
