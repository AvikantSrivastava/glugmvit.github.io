excerpt: Our experience with hosting Global Diversity CFP Day at Sir M. Visvesvaraya Institute of Technology, Bangalore, in association with Mozilla.
---
On Saturday 2nd March 2019 we hosted the second edition of Global Diversity CFP Day following the success of the 2018 event where 53 workshops took place!
In 2019 there will be numerous workshops hosted around the globe encouraging and advising newbie speakers to put together their very first talk proposal and share their own individual perspective on any subject of interest to people in tech.
These workshops have no specific language, framework or process as a focus. Even if your talk isn’t even related to tech we want to hear from you too! In short, if there is something that you want to shout to the world we're here to help you get there regardless of the boundaries of technology or communities.

## About the event (in detail):
The event was organized by the *Computer Science & Engineering Department* of [Sir M. Visvesvaraya Institute of Technology](https://www.sirmvit.edu/), Bangalore. The event began with an invocation keynote after which the presentations started. 4 speakers registered and participated to present their talks on technical topics. Each speaker was given a total of 20 minutes to present their talk after which 10 minutes were reserved for the guests to give feedback on the talk to the speaker.
Students were able to interact with mentors from Mozilla and get valuable inputs from them and validate their ideas and work on the loopholes their ideas might have. The speakers gained insights from the mentors about how to effectively present a technical talk and keep the audience engaged. The event ended with a closing keynote by the guests after which the audience was dispersed.
